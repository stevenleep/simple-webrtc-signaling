# simple-webrtc-signaling
This is a basic WebRTC signaling implementation. It empowers real-time communication between web browsers, facilitating direct data exchange (e.g., video, audio) without intermediary servers handling the media stream.

## Technology Stack
- NodeJS:
  - NodeJS provides a server - side runtime environment that is event - driven and non - blocking. This architecture is highly efficient for handling multiple concurrent connections, which is crucial in a real - time communication context. It allows the server to handle many signaling requests from different clients simultaneously without getting blocked, enabling a smooth and responsive communication experience.
- Express:
  - Express is a lightweight and flexible web application framework. It simplifies the process of building RESTful APIs and handling routing. In this project, it's used to define the endpoints for the signaling server. For example, it can manage the connection requests from clients, the exchange of session descriptions, and candidate information. Express makes it easy to organize and manage these different routes and the logic associated with them, ensuring a well - structured and maintainable server - side application.
- Socket.io: 
  - Socket.io is essential for enabling real - time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server. In a WebRTC setup, the signaling process requires quick and reliable back - and - forth communication. Socket.io provides an easy - to - use API that allows the server to send and receive messages to/from clients instantly. This real - time communication channel is used to exchange the necessary signaling messages such as ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) candidates and SDP (Session Description Protocol) offers and answers, which are vital for establishing a direct peer - to - peer connection between browsers.
- Redis:
  - Caching Signaling States: In a WebRTC signaling system, there are various states that need to be managed. For example, the state of a connection attempt, the list of available peers, and the status of ICE candidates exchanged. Redis, as an in - memory data store, provides a fast and efficient way to cache these states. By caching, the application can quickly access and update the relevant information without having to recompute or reload it from other slower storage systems.
  - Managing Session Information: When multiple clients are involved in a real - time communication session, Redis can be used to store and manage session - related data. For instance, it can keep track of which clients are part of a particular video - conferencing session or collaborative editing session. This helps in ensuring that the correct signaling messages are sent to the appropriate clients and that the overall session management is efficient.
  - Scalability and Distributed Systems: In a more complex setup where the application might need to scale horizontally (i.e., adding more servers), Redis can play a crucial role. It can act as a central data store that different server instances can access to share and synchronize signaling information. This allows for a more scalable and distributed architecture, ensuring that the real - time communication system can handle a large number of clients and sessions without sacrificing performance.

## How to Start
- Install Docker: Ensure that Docker is installed on your system. If not, download and install it according to the official Docker documentation for your operating system.
- Build and Run with Docker Compose:
  - Open a terminal and navigate to the project root directory.
  - Run the command docker compose up --build. This command will build the Docker images based on the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml configurations in the project. It will also start the containers, initializing the application with all the necessary services and dependencies.


Once the above steps are completed successfully, the application will be up and running, ready to handle WebRTC signaling and enable real-time communication between connected clients.
